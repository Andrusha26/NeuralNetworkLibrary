# NeuralNetworkLibrary
It is a simple multilayer (3) neural network I've created.

In order to start you need go to ./ConsoleNandGateSample directory.

type:
dotnet build

then:
dotnet run

First step - neural network is training - you'll see error.
Second step - you can try to test it by yourself.
